üîπ Bluetooth Control Bot

The Bluetooth Control Bot is an Arduino-based project that allows users to control a robotic vehicle wirelessly using a smartphone via Bluetooth communication. It demonstrates the use of embedded systems, motor control, and serial communication for wireless robotics applications.

üöÄ Features

Control bot movement (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop) using a mobile app.

Wireless communication using HC-05 Bluetooth module.

Dual motor control with L298N Motor Driver.

Compact and easy-to-build hardware design.

Real-time response and smooth directional control.

‚öôÔ∏è Components Used

Arduino UNO / Nano

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

L298N Motor Driver Module

DC Motors & Wheels

Battery Pack

Chassis and Jumper Wires

üí° Working Principle

The bot receives commands from the smartphone app via the HC-05 Bluetooth module. The Arduino processes these commands and drives the motors accordingly through the L298N motor driver, enabling smooth navigation and control.

üì± Mobile App

Any standard Bluetooth terminal app (like Bluetooth RC Controller) can be used to send directional commands.

üß† Learning Outcome

Understanding UART communication between Arduino and Bluetooth.

Implementation of motor driver interfacing.

Practical experience with embedded systems and wireless control.
